There\u2019s also the danger of comparison. For example, you might be a good height, but if the person next to you is 6\u201D4, then you will look short in the photo.</li><li>According to a <a href="https://medium.com/@Hinge/hinge-the-relationship-app-28f1000d5e76" target="_blank">Hinge study</a>, when standing alone, women are 69% more likely to receive a like and men are 11% more likely to receive a like.Avoid selfies</li><li>Your profile should capture your unique personality and interests\u2014and a selfie doesn\u2019t do this. According to that same Hinge study, selfies are 40% less likely to receive a like. (What\u2019s worse is a bathroom selfie, which is 90% less likely to receive a like.)Don\u2019t hide your eyes (aka no sunglasses)</li><li>A picture with sunglasses is the equivalent of avoiding eye contact, which can come off as shady. The Hinge study found that profiles were 41% less likely to receive a like if sunglasses were worn.Don\u2019t use unclear/inaccurate pictures.</li></ol><p>This includes blurry photos, really old photos, and heavily filtered or edited photos. If the pictures look inconsistent, people will question what you actually look like. It\u2019s ok if you have less than the maximum number of photos\u2014quality (and consistency) over quantity. </p></article>'},"fake-accounts":{title:"Are you wasting time on a fake account?",img:"undraw-live-photo.png",preview:"",tags:["fake","accounts","tips"],content:'<article><p>Dating apps are time consuming as is\u2014you don\u2019t need to waste time on fake accounts. (Which account for an estimated 10% of dating profiles.)</p><p>Here\u2019s are some tips to help you steer clear of fake accounts:</p><p>The easiest way is to just let the app do the work for you\u2014prioritize users who have verified their accounts.</p><ol class="list-decimal list-inside"><li><strong>Dating apps with verified function</strong><br><br><strong>Bumble</strong> has a Photo Verification feature\u2014To get the verified badge, users are given a random pose to mimic, and the photo is reviewed by a real person on the Bumble team. This prevents not just fake accounts but also catfishing.<strong>Tinder</strong> has not only a Photo Verification feature but also and ID Verification.<br><br>If you prefer to use an app that doesn\u2019t have those features, here are some tips for spotting fake accounts:</li><li><strong>Pictures that are too posed or low resolution</strong><br><br>Fake accounts usually steal photos from smaller influencers. However, influencers tend to post posed pictures in very picturesque places. Fake accounts generally screenshot these, so the pictures they have will all be lower resolution.<br><br>In general, the more casual \u201Cnormal\u201D pictures there are, the less likely the account is fake. (Such as pictures with friends, candid photos in less picturesque settings, etc).<br><br>If the profile seems suspicious, you can try doing a reverse Google image search as well.</li><li><strong>Empty bios or nonsensical prompts</strong><br><br>My friend was once accused of being a fake account because she had grammatical mistakes in her profile\u2014the guy didn\u2019t realize that it was just because English was her second language. A more accurate way of detecting a fake account is nonsensical language\u2014usually something that sounds long-winded and Google translated, like \u201CWhat do you think about treating other sincerely, without cheating or betrayal?\u201D</li><li><strong>Using Linkedin</strong><br><br>Limitation: People may feel uncomfortable sharing their social media, even if they aren\u2019t fake accounts.<br><br>But if the natural conversation has covered education and job history, then it might be worth it to check to see if you can find them on Linkedin. If that\u2019s too stalker-like for you, then you can also consider apps like <strong>The League</strong> which require free users to be verified through Linkedin.</li><li><strong>Meeting them in person</strong><br><br>The most direct and least stalker-like tip\u2014meet them in person!<br><br>Most dating apps have algorithms that take into account who you have liked or matched with in the past\u2014so avoid matching with too many fake accounts! Or the algorithm will keep pushing fake accounts to you.</li></ol><br><p>Hopefully these tips will help you weed out the fake accounts and focus on the ones that really matter.
