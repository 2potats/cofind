				Hi! We’re Jen and Jamie, and we want to help you find love on dating apps. Searching for
				love on a dating app is kind of like searching for a job–good candidates get passed on if
				their resumes haven’t been strategically written and customized.
			</p>
			<p class="leading-normal text-lg mb-4">
				We believe that we can help raise your profile above all the others, so that you can be seen
				and liked by the people that you’re interested in.
			</p>
			<h4 class="my-4 text-2xl font-bold leading-tight">About Jen</h4>
			<p class="leading-normal text-lg mb-2">
				Hi, I’m Jen, and I’ll be looking over your profiles and questions.
			</p>
			<p class="leading-normal text-lg mb-2">
				I studied Psychology at Columbia University, Fashion Design at Parsons, and I am now
				pursuing my MBA at Wharton. Before Wharton, I was an entrepreneur for 4 years, where I
				learned to market my own brand and build up my social media account with over 75k followers,
				experimenting with different copy and visuals to optimize results.
			</p>
			<p class="leading-normal text-lg mb-2">
				I realized that I could do the same thing with dating apps, and helped many of my friends
				optimize their dating profiles. I helped some friends take some new photos that emphasized
				their best traits–I did the same for their bios. These friends are all in relationships now.
